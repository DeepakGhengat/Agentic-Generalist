Posted on December 21, 2023 Uncover the potential of AI. Learn the definition of AI, how it works, and educational/career opportunities. (AI) Artificial Intelligence: What is the definition of AI and how does AI work? Copy link A recurring theme in science fiction, artificial intelligence (AI) has captured our collective imagination and enthralled audiences for over a century. From the early days of science fiction literature to the captivating narratives of iconic movies, the concept of intelligent machines has been a source of fascination and speculation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables machines to learn from experience, adapt to new inputs, and execute tasks resembling human capabilities. By leveraging AI technologies, computers can undergo training to perform particular tasks through the analysis of extensive data sets and the identification of patterns within the data. What is the definition of Artificial Intelligence? Artificial intelligence represents a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience (machine learning), understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. From self-driving cars to virtual personal assistants, AI is reshaping various aspects of our daily lives, and its significance continues to grow. \u201cComputer science is about building recipes to achieve different goals and objectives,\u201d said Dr. Ian Kash, Associate Professor for the University of Illinois Chicago\u2019s online Master of Engineering with a concentration in AI and Machine Learning (MEng) program . \u201cIn many areas of computer science, we can build things that are guaranteed to do what we want. However, there are a lot of extremely difficult problems in the world. So, to me, the field of AI is a set of techniques and tools that have been developed to solve these hard problems even when we can&#8217;t get a fully satisfying &#8216;just follow this recipe\u2019 solution.\u201d One pivotal moment in the exploration of AI came in 1950 with the visionary work of British polymath, Alan Turing . In his paper, &#8220;Computing Machinery and Intelligence,&#8221; Turing introduced the Turing test and explored the mathematical possibilities of AI and questioned why machines couldn&#8217;t leverage available info",
